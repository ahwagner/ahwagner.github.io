Hello all,

Just a reminder that tomorrow are general municipal elections for the =
state of Missouri.

You are invited to view my slide deck (here =
<https://www.dropbox.com/s/5zmeshkbc529bpb/vote.pdf?dl=3D0>) containing =
links, descriptions, and synopses of the county, city, and Metropolitan =
Saint Louis Sewer District propositions (along with pictorial =
approximations of the geographical areas voting on these measures).

Many municipalities have additional propositions or elections to be held =
tomorrow that are not discussed in the linked presentation. However, =
information on how to retrieve a sample ballot for your municipality is =
also provided at the beginning of the county and city sections.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

And remember, GO VOTE!

Best,
Alex Wagner

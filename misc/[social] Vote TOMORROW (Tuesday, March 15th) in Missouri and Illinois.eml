Hello all,

As many of you are aware, the US presidential preference primaries are =
upon us. The next presidential term is as important as ever, as the =
president elect will have to address several critical issues, including =
staggering income inequality =
<http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/economic-inequality-it-s-far-wo=
rse-than-you-think/>, a crumbling national infrastructure =
<http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/>, global climate change =
<http://climate.nasa.gov/>, and an exponentially increasing level of =
partisanship=E2=80=94and exponentially decreasing productivity=E2=80=94in =
the US congress =
<http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=3D10.1371/journal.pone.012350=
7>. In addition, the next president will also likely have the =
responsibility of appointing several new justices to the supreme court =
during his or her term, shaping the next few decades of interpretation =
of US law.=20

With all of that in mind, if you would like to vote on which =
presidential candidates will be on the ballot in November, your =
opportunity to do so is tomorrow. This email contains information about =
how, when, and where to vote, as well as links to the campaign sites for =
the actively campaigning candidates in the Democratic and Republican =
parties.

I serve as a member of the Steering Committee governing the technical direction
of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH), an international
Standards Development Organization (SDO) supporting genomic and health data
sharing. I also lead the Variation Representation
team of the GA4GH Genomic Knowledge Standards Work Stream. In that role, I have
led the collaborative design and development of the Variation Representation
Specification for the computable representation of molecular variation.

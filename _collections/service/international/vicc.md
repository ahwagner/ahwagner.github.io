As Director of the Variant Interpretation for Cancer Consortium (VICC), my
work to organize and promote the VICC research and activities is a small but
critical part of my involvement with this consortium. The vast majority of my
time in VICC is spent participating in collaborative standards and tool
development research, including my 2020 Nature Genetics publication describing
the creation and analysis of a harmonized clinical variant evidence
knowledgebase. This research effort is directly supported by a K99 / R00 award
from the National Human Genome Research Institute.

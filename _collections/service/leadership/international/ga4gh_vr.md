I lead the Variation Representation team of the Genomic Knowledge Standards 
Work Stream of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH). In that 
role, I have led the collaborative design and development of the Variation 
Representation Specification (VRS) for the computable representation of 
molecular variation.

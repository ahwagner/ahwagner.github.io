I serve as a member of the ClinGen Data Platform Team. My role on this
committee is to advise on the data standards surrounding somatic knowledge.
I am working closely with this team to develop the next version of the 
ClinGen Genomic Classification Data Model for use by the ClinGen Evidence
Repository, as well as in my own research program.

I serve as a member of the ClinGen Hematologic Cancer Task Force. My role on this 
committee is to develop and propose ClinGen standards for the interpretation of 
somatic variants in hematologic cancers. I also advise on the curation of clinical 
evidence for variants in the CIViC knowledgebase and the coordination of activities
with the American Society for Hematology Somatic Precision Oncology group.

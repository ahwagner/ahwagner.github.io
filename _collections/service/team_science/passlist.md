This project identified lists of genes and hotspots that flags variants for
review that would otherwise be filtered by variant calling and annotation
pipeline.

Initial target is a short list (10s of genes) from the following sources:
  - PeCAN
  - CIViC
  - Nature 2018 Article: "The landscape of genomic alterations across
    childhood cancers"
